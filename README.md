## ü§ì Case <a name = "case"></a>

As a developer and expert on SQL, you were contacted by a company that needs your help to manage their database which runs on PostgreSQL. The database provided contains four entities: Employee, Office, Countries and States. The company has different headquarters in various places around the world, in turn, each headquarters has a group of employees of which it is hierarchically organized and each employee may have a supervisor. You are also provided with the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

#### ERD - Diagram <br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Docker Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

---

## üìö Recover the data to your machine <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:15.2
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```

3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

5. Close the database connection:

```
\q
```

4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat /.../dump.sql | docker exec -i nerdery-container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the src folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge

## üìä Excersises <a name = "excersises"></a>

Now it's your turn to write SQL queries to achieve the following results (You need to write the query in the section `Your query here` on each question):

1. Total money of all the accounts group by types.

```
SELECT accounts.type, SUM(accounts.mount) AS total
FROM accounts
GROUP BY accounts.type;

```

2. How many users with at least 2 `CURRENT_ACCOUNT`.

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS users_with_at_least_two_accounts
FROM (
    SELECT accounts.user_id
    FROM accounts
    WHERE accounts.type = 'CURRENT_ACCOUNT'
    GROUP BY accounts.user_id
    HAVING COUNT(accounts.type) >= 2
) AS subquery;

```

3. List the top five accounts with more money.

```
SELECT accounts.id, accounts.user_id, accounts.type, accounts.mount
FROM accounts
ORDER BY accounts.mount DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

4. Get the three users with the most money after making movements.

```
WITH user_balances AS (
    SELECT
        a.user_id,
        SUM(CASE
    			WHEN m.type = 'IN' OR (m.type IN ('TRANSFER', 'OTHER') AND m.account_to = a.id) THEN m.mount
    			WHEN (m.type IN ('TRANSFER', 'OTHER') AND m.account_from = a.id) OR m.type = 'OUT' THEN -m.mount
                ELSE 0
            END) + a.mount AS total_balance
    FROM
        accounts a
    LEFT JOIN
    	movements m ON a.id IN (m.account_from, m.account_to)
    GROUP BY
        a.user_id, a.mount
)
SELECT
    ub.user_id,
    SUM(ub.total_balance) AS total_balance
FROM
    user_balances ub
GROUP BY
    ub.user_id
ORDER BY
    total_balance DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

5.  In this part you need to create a transaction with the following steps:

            a. First, get the ammount for the account `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf` and `fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590` after all their movements.
            b. Add a new movement with the information:
                from: `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf` make a transfer to `fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590`
                mount: 50.75

            c. Add a new movement with the information:
                from: `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf`
                type: OUT
                mount: 731823.56

                * Note: if the account does not have enough money you need to reject this insert and make a rollback for the entire transaction

```
